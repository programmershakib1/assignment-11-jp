# Task Management (Client Side)

## Short Description

This is the client-side of the Task Management application. It provides an interactive user interface for managing tasks, including functionalities such as task categorization (To-Do, In Progress, Done), task creation, editing, deletion, drag-and-drop reordering, and task filtering. The frontend is built using React.js, React Query, and integrates with the backend API for real-time data fetching. The UI is responsive and styled with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI.
